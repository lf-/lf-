[rust](https://rust-lang.org) and hardware

#### stuff i do for work

- maintain [lti13](https://github.com/lf-/lti13), the Haskell library for
  Learning Tools Interoperability 1.3 for learning tools, allowing one click
  login and automatic grade reporting for students on most learning
  management systems. i also maintain its integration in
  [carnap.io](https://github.com/carnap/carnap)

  enabling developers to get a known working Haskell + GHCJS development
  environment on any Linux computer in three commands

#### stuff i've written for fun

  search tool for Nix documentation written in rust, supporting interactively
  reading nixpkgs documentation while using the Nix REPL
- [mu](https://github.com/lf-/mu), a work-in-progress kernel in rust
- [pwintln](https://github.com/lf-/pwintln) uwu, a rust hack that hooks
